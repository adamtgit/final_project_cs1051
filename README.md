Why We Chose This Project
Both of us are pre-medical students taking computer science to help broaden our perspectives/skill sets so we decided to make a final project that would combine both of these interests in a fun way. 

Purpose/Explanation of Project
The purpose of this project is to simulate a medical case so prospective pre-health students can use it as practice for clinicals. It walks you through all of the steps of having a patient: asking them history, conducting the physical exam, making a diagnosis, choosing treatment, etcâ€¦ It also gives you warning signs when you get something wrong so that you can go back and correct it; in some instances it even explains why you are wrong to help you learn. 
From a coding point of view, it uses renpy to mimic a choose your own adventure game with a visual interface. During the game, you are able to see the choices and make them accordingly in an interactive way. You are even able to add your own name to it to personalize it which helps make it feel more realistic. 

Challenges in Coding 
One of the biggest challenges in coding was learning renpy. While it is rooted in python which we spent the semester learning, there were a lot of new features and statements involved that we needed to get accustomed to. Once we spent time reading the documentation and playing around with it though, it became easier and clear that our background knowledge in python helped immensely.
