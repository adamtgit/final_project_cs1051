# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Google Docs (with a doctor icon)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This project is a game that lets you simulate treating a patient as a doctor in charge of a healthcare team.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will simulate a patient's condition and response to different types of treatment and diagnostic procedures. It will feature a sidebar with the patient's vital signs and a main screen with an image diagram of a human body with abnormal conditions shown in the patient's body. The image will be imported using the same code used to import the hurricane map image from the hurricane lab. Any course of action performed (through text input) will be reflected in a change in body appearance, vital sign change, or a written text response back. The treatment and diagnostic procedures will be effected using either direct text input, with keyword detection used to comprehend the nature of the order, or options that can be chosen by typing in certain numbers.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Adam Tseng, adam.tseng@temple.edu, Joanne Nichols

Ishika Kohli, ishika.kohli@temple.edu,  Hongzheng Wang

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be if the game does what we intended it to do (run through the medical cases and different options), even if it does not have all of the fancy graphics.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be if the game ran through the medical cases and different options as stated earlier, just with some graphics to make the game more captivating and less plain text interaction.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be for us to get all of the graphics to work in our code respective to the actions that the player takes, making it an interface oriented game. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

For our next steps, we want to focus on getting more comfortable with renpy so that we can figure out how to make our game more visual and interactive as well as incorporate input from the player to get us through the case. Once we are more comfortable with that, we will work on adding buttons and other things which can make the game more appealing, like little add on icons and maybe even a little music. Then, we will put together the actual medical case using Adam and I’s background in medicine (coming from the same medical magnet high school) to make it as accurate as possible. Because there are two of us, we are going to first learn all of the new skills independently and then meet up in order to work on it and integrate our ideas. We’ll get a better idea on who will do what after we both research renpy and see what we’re most comfortable with and interested in.
