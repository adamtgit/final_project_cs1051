# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Doing something that is a mix of operation and chooe your own adventure; medical case studied
- import in a human body to depict the patient
- they have a certain condition, and you are given options on how to treat them based on that
-patient stats and such change based on what you choose (get worse if wrong, get better if right)

The purpose is that it's a good game for people who are pre-med (Adam and I) to practice cases
